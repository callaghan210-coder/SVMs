# Overview of SVMs

Support Vector Machines (SVMs) are versatile machine learning algorithms designed for both linear and non-linear classification. The main goal of SVMs is to find an optimal hyperplane that separates data points of different classes while maximizing the margin between them. This maximization helps improve generalization to unseen data.

## The Hyperplane

The hyperplane is the decision boundary that divides the feature space into regions corresponding to different classes. In 2D, it’s a line; in 3D, it’s a plane; and in higher dimensions, it’s an abstract boundary. SVMs aim to maximize the margin between classes. If perfect separation is not possible, a soft margin is introduced to allow for some misclassifications.

## Support Vectors

Support vectors are the critical data points closest to the hyperplane. They define its position and orientation. These points are crucial for the model’s decision-making process, while points farther away from the hyperplane do not affect the boundary. This selective focus on support vectors makes SVMs robust to noise and outliers.

## The Margin

The margin is the distance between the hyperplane and the closest support vectors. A larger margin typically enhances generalization and reduces misclassification. Maximizing the margin is key to SVM performance.

## The Kernel Trick

When data is not linearly separable, SVMs use kernel functions to map data into higher-dimensional spaces where linear separation becomes feasible. Common kernels include:
- **Linear Kernel**: For linearly separable data.
- **Polynomial Kernel**: For capturing complex relationships.
- **RBF Kernel**: For highly non-linear patterns.
- **Sigmoid Kernel**: Used in neural network-like models.

# Hyperparameter Tuning

To achieve optimal performance with the Radial Basis Function (RBF) kernel, we applied grid search combined with cross-validation to explore the best hyperparameter combinations. This approach helped us fine-tune the model while avoiding overfitting.

## Key Hyperparameters Tuned

### C (Regularization Parameter)

- Governs the trade-off between a large margin and minimizing misclassifications.
- Smaller C values create broader decision margins, improving generalization.
- Larger C values aim for perfect classification of training points but risk overfitting, especially with noisy data.

### Gamma (Kernel Parameter)

- Determines how far the influence of a single training example reaches.
- Lower gamma values produce smoother decision boundaries.
- Higher gamma values focus on nearby points, potentially leading to overfitting.

## Results

The grid search results for the Iris dataset were as follows:
- **Linear Kernel**: `C = 1`, accuracy = 91%
- **Polynomial Kernel**: `C = 10`, `degree = 3`, accuracy = 91%
- **RBF Kernel**: `C = 10`, `gamma = 0.01`, accuracy = 91%

These results indicate that all kernels performed similarly in terms of accuracy, achieving around 91% accuracy on the test set. Despite some differences in parameter settings, the models were quite effective in handling the data.

# Insights and Recommendations

## Kernel Selection

- **Linear Kernel**: Best for linearly separable data or high-dimensional datasets.
- **Polynomial Kernel**: Suitable for moderate non-linear relationships.
- **RBF Kernel**: The most versatile but requires careful parameter tuning.

## Hyperparameter Tuning

- Always optimize **C** and **gamma** to balance accuracy and generalization.

## Feature Scaling

- Standardize features to prevent bias, especially for kernels sensitive to feature magnitudes.

## Computational Considerations

- Linear kernels are faster and more scalable.
- Non-linear kernels, particularly RBF, can be computationally intensive for large datasets.

# Conclusion

This assignment explored the theoretical and practical aspects of Support Vector Machines, including kernel selection, hyperparameter tuning, and feature scaling. The results obtained indicate the importance of proper kernel selection and tuning in achieving optimal performance. SVMs continue to be an essential tool for various machine learning applications, particularly in classification tasks.
